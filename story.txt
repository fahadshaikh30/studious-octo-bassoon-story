this is my story

Fahad is a student in professor Deb's CS400 class. He's interested for Thursday's lecture on BTrees.
It seemed to be very difficult to many students! 

However, with the help of his wonderful xteam, he learned to absolutely love
cs400 with all of his heart. Fahad enjoyed remotely logging into linux 
terminals in the cs labs, and that was his favorite thing to do in his spare
time. But one day when he remotely logged in he remembered that he had not finished his x3 assignment. So he opened his favorite editor vim and finished his story.
